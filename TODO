- information on mouse over with 3 last actions on a ticket
- modification in bold + blink tray icon
- keep order after add or delete
- add keyboard events on login, password and tickets fields
- move task from a tab to another

---

task.tickets = ticket by tabs
task.data = all tickets data, no tab information there
when refreshing, check if ticket has not already been processed, if so skip it

we can add non existant ticket
factorize settings objects

handle settings loading errors (in case there are errors in them)

handle tab based on redmine filter and/or specific search

---

Handle versions:

use tag objects:
curl -i https://api.github.com/repos/:user/:repo/tags
and parse dates
maybe use a naming convention for stable and beta releases, and up to master
then download tar.gz to update itself
